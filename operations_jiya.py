# EXERCISE 9, Part 2

# ASK VICTORIA - everytime I used input and another print why did it not work at the same time?
# the var is an easy way of outputting the string
var = input("please enter a value: ").upper()


# now we need to print it but the value of var in uppercase


print('uppercase', var)

# WHY IS IT NOT UPPERCASE!
